# Marengo's Archcfg Repo
Yeah, it's basically all of my text config. Storing it to not lose and cut down on the amount of configuration necessary later down the line.

## Remarks
- The reference to username is replaced with ```__usrname__```, so that it could be replaced automatically in case a script is used to restore those cfg values.
- The configs are probably not very good and are geared towards my setup. If you tried them and noticed issues, please create an issue.
